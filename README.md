## Description
After testing out Extraplanetary Launchpads and Roverdude's MK/OKS, I had the idea of creating a simple, user friendly mod that would allow you to build rockets without taking a 200MB hit to RAM or having to juggle multitudes of resource pathways. If you know how to set up a drill, ISRU and a fuel tank for an Ore to Fuel conversion, then you should know how to build rockets.

## Features
- No extra parts
- No RAM usage
- Added functionality for the Mobile Processing Lab in the late game
- Simple, configurable and adds levels of depth to the gameplay without a learning curve

## Requires
- Module Manager

## License
- MIT
